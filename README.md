Introduction about Project
BCIS Sathi is the web base application for providing all necessary and important notes and study material for BCIS students all over Nepal. Students can get notes on the basis of their needs, like semester, subject or chapter etc. Students can go through specific topic for notes and other material.
1.2	Literature Review
There are a lot of websites which provides the studies material for bachelors students. We don’t know how much they are trustable and right. Even we don’t know about the notes provider, either he/she are students or teacher or many more. So, BCIS Sathi is fully controlled from students and notes are provided under the supervision of some specific teachers.
1.3	Title (Problem Statement)
BCIS Sathi is the web base application for providing all necessary and important notes and study material for BCIS students all over Nepal.
1.4	Objectives
The purpose of developing BCIS Sathi is to provide proper notes and studied material to BCIS students. This BCIS Sathi is user friendly because gathering the notes is fast and data is maintained efficiently. 
1.5	Scope
We have a lot of websites, which provides the notes to students, but they haven’t complete note as well as authentic. Students can’t find all material they need at same place in managed way. So, BCIS Sathi will help to gather information related to BCIS program at proper managed way.

1.6.3	Cost Estimation
There are different types of cost estimation technique available in the market. I used Analogous Estimating method for estimating cost of my project. This technique is used to estimate the project cost when very little detail about the project is available. Therefore, this technique does not provide a very reliable estimation. The primary benefits of this technique are its lower cost and quick results. In Analogous Estimation, the cost of the project is estimated by comparing it with similar projects previously completed by organization. Here, the cost is estimated by the organization’s historical records for previously completed projects. And the cost is estimated by closest to our project and determine the cost estimate of our current project. Hence, the cost estimation of the system “BCIS Sathi” is Rs 20,000. 
CHAPTER 2: SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
2.1 Methodology
2.1.1 Software development life cycle
The software industry includes many different processes, for example, analysis, development, maintenance and publication of software. This industry also includes software services, such as training, documentation, and consulting.
My focus here about software development life cycle (SDLC). So, due to that different types of projects have different requirements. Therefore, it may be required to choose the SDLC phases according to the specific needs of the project. These different requirements and needs give us various software development approaches to choose from during software implementation.
2.1.2 V-Shaped Model
 Description
It is an extension of waterfall model, Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The major difference between v-shaped model and waterfall model is the early test planning in the v-shaped model.
 Figure 2.1.2 v-shaped model 
2.2 MVC Framework
MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns.
•	Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.
•	View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.
•	Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.
 
CHAPTER 3: IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 Introduction:
Implementation is the stage where the theoretical design is turned into a working system .The most crucial stage in achieving a new successful system and in giving confidence on the new system for the users that it will work efficiently and effectively. The system can be implemented only after through testing is done and if it is found to work according to the specification. It involves careful planning, investigation, of the current system and its constraints on implementation, design of methods to achieve the change over and an evaluation of change over methods a part from planning. Two major tasks of preparing the implementation are education and tanning of the user and testing of the system. 
The implementation phase comprises of several activities. The required hardware and software acquisition is carried out. The system may require some software to be developed.
3.2 Software Requirements
Microsoft word 2010. 
It is used to develop all the documentation for the Minor Project, “BCIS Sathi”.
Operating System: 
Any operating system such as windows, Linux etc.
Programming Language:
PHP is a server side scripting language. that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web applications. PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages. PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed. The client computers accessing the PHP scripts require a web browser only. A PHP file contains PHP tags and ends with the extension ".php".


HTML
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out. So for example, CSS can be used to alter the font, color, size and spacing of the content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

Sublime:
Sublime Text is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plug-in, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.
Database (MySQL): 
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. MySQL is an open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS); it is a popular database for use in web applications, and is a central part of the greatly used LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl/PHP/Python) open-source web application software stack. MySQL is used by many applications like, Word Press, Joomla, and TYPO3etc

Supporting tools (Xampp)
XAMPP is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes. Everything needed to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MariaDB), and scripting language (PHP) – is included in an extractable file. XAMPP is cross-platform, which means it works equally well on Linux, Mac and Windows. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server easy. 
CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSION AND LESSON LEARNT
4.1 Work Achievement:
 By the completion of this project I have learnt much more things better than before about the real time working environment on web based applications. I have learnt how time is managed, budgets are allocated and manpower is used, to make the project successful.
4.2 Limitations
BCIS Sathi can used by only BCIS students and course related students.
4.3 Future Extension
I will do some improvements in my project (BCIS Sathi) in order to make it advanced and reliable by doing the following changes.
•	In future BCIS Sathi can also provide the notes for other faculty like BBA, BHCM, BBA-BI.
•	Old questions, assignment and guide etc also can include.
•	Students(user) can also upload/post the studied material.
4.4 Conclusion
BCIS Sathi plays a vital role for sharing notes for BCIS students. It will be quite easy to get notes and studying well.
